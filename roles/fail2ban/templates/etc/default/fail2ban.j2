# valid options.
FAIL2BAN_OPTS="{{ fail2ban_opts }}"

# Run fail2ban as a different user. If not set, fail2ban
# will run as root.
#
# The user is not created automatically.
# The user can be created e.g. with
#    useradd --system --no-create-home --home-dir / --groups adm fail2ban
# Log files are readable by group adm by default. Adding the fail2ban
# user to this group allows it to read the logfiles.
#
# Another manual step that needs to be taken is to allow write access
# for fail2ban user to fail2ban log files. The /etc/init.d/fail2ban
# script will change the ownership when starting fail2ban. Logrotate
# needs to be configured seperately, see /etc/logrotate.d/fail2ban.
